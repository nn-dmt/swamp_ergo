## Background
Some reasons behind the re-launch of swamp.audio.

## Market Gaps

### Rights / royalties management in the NFT space

Is limited to basic resale condition royalties or management of rights and royalties on specific layer two platforms. 


### Collaborative works and royalty based assets on layer 1

There is no present solution native to layer 1 which allows for collaborative works between multiple artists, or multiple works from the same artist in one pack.


### Little or none P2P music/media distribution systems

### Marketing Lead: Ryan Conklin

Innovator. Poet. Digital Storyteller. Creative Strategist.

> "Storytelling, both with words and images, has been a passion and natural talent of mine since I was a child. 

> By embracing both creativity and data/analytics, I’ve helped companies such as ConstantContact, Live Nation, [StubHub](https://ryan-conklin.squarespace.com/#/stubhub-work/), and [Ebay](https://ryan-conklin.squarespace.com/#/ebay/), and many more stand out more from competitors with innovative digital experiences. I believe that it's more impactful to invite customers into the brand experience, and by doing so, have  the customer want to invite our brand into their own story."
