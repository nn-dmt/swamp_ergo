## Market Gaps

### Rights / royalties management in the NFT space

Is limited to basic resale condition royalties or management of rights and royalties on specific layer two platforms. 


### Collaborative works and royalty based assets on layer 1

There is no present solution native to layer 1 which allows for collaborative works between multiple artists, or multiple works from the same artist in one pack.


### Little or none P2P music/media distribution systems

I believe that it's more impactful to invite customers into the brand experience, and by doing so, have  the customer want to invite our brand into their own story."
