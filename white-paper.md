# Swamp.Audio Whitepaper

## A Layer-1 on-chain royalty management system & Layer 2 DAO Media publisher

## Background
In 2013, Swamp music was originally created as a safe space for music artists to explore new ideas and passions, ones which weren’t restricted to the ‘formulas’ that most big record labels try to enforce onto their artists. 

And so it feels like a natural evolution for us to move into the blockchain and decentralized spaces to try to shake things up a bit with our existing in-house knowledge on publishing digital media and tracking royalties for that media.

In the decentralized/blockchain space, pretty much anyone who has been there a while would tell you it’s sort of a ‘wild west’ and that you should be careful. We are in agreement here, and think that it’s important for the developer teams and companies working in the space to build safe solutions for real people and not just try to capitalize on the next hype train to turn a quick buck. 

So far, our experience in the space so far has been closer to the latter than the former, so we decided to start making moves to enhance the state of the technology and the experience for media producers and consumers on engaging on decentralized platforms.


### Lack of representation for music in the digital space

3 Ways working for exposure hurts musicians:

```
•More than **365 million active monthly users** on Spotify
•More than **165 million** of these monthly users pay for Spotify Premium
•Spotify’s quarterly revenue in the **first quarter of 2019 was more than 1.8 billion euros**. 
•Gross profit in the **first quarter of 2020 was 472 million euros with an operating loss of 17 million**

**The amount that a stream is worth to an artist is low, with estimates being as low as $0.00318 per stream**

### Value for music and musicians not aligning with inflation

### Post-COVID world for creative professionals

The effect that Covid had on economies and small business world-wide is unquestionable…
But few working professionals were hit harder than musicians, who essentially relied on their touring income to make ends meet (as the media sales by this point have all but dropped away). Many small and medium musicians have had to get other jobs instead of relying solely on their crafts.

Conversely, we have seen a surge in podcast and streaming consumption, media companies turning record profits, and the musicians getting fractions of pennies.


### NFTs, decentralization & WEB 3.0




## Market Gaps

### Rights / royalties management in the NFT space

Is limited to basic resale condition royalties or management of rights and royalties on specific layer two platforms. Once you mint an NFT, there is the option to set the 'royalty' percentage, which is just the % amount of the resale value the original maker expects to be paid upon resale of the work. Compared to current media licensing rights abilities this is fairly primitive.


### Collaborative works and royalty based assets on layer 1

There is no present solution native to layer 1 which allows for collaborative works between multiple artists, or multiple works from the same artist in one pack. Full albums of works can be multiple files, and include both audio and visual art - indicating that in its present state, the music NFT requires a layer two solution to organize album-based NFT music content. This is not an optimal solution in our eyes as it adds layers of complexity to the process of distribution and royalties.


### Little or none P2P music/media distribution systems

### Who owns the music?
Surprise, it's not the person who made it or the person who buys it - it's the music publisher (often the label or rights management group)


### Lack of a proper Audio/Music NFT market

## Product Vision

### Blockchain Distribution & rights management

The tools we’re building aim to close the gap a bit when it comes to fans and music makers, and to remove the barriers to entry into the decentralized space so that musicians and fans alike can have easy and safe access to creative projects hosted on the blockchain. To do this, we are developing new NFT minting schemas, creating custom middleware to interact with the blockchain by using flat-file ‘database-less’ content management systems, and creating some value generation and royalty tracking tools for our own roster and anyone who wants to adopt the open-source standard for groups of works.

## [WIP] Tokenomics

Token name: ROYALTY MANAGEMENT TOKEN (RMT)

### [WIP] Token Distribution

40 million max supply


### [WIP] Emission

All tokens will be released within a period of 14 months

### [WIP] Utility 

THE RMT token holders can stake their RMT and receive RIGHTS-LP tokens in exchange - by doing so they will be staking into the royalty payout system.

## Disclaimer 

Although all measures will be taken to stay autonomous, transparent and risk-free, there is inherint risk in the decentralized and blockchain spaces.

We encourage you to ask challenging questions and do your own research when it comes to all claims made about our platform or from anyone who represents it. We also encourage you to do the same with Ergo, and you will probably see why we are using it as our network of choice. 

As robust and transparent as Ergo is for a blockchain network, we are still in the infancy of decentralization and there is much room to grow.
